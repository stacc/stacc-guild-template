# Stacc Guild Template

This template/framework is intended to make it easier for anyone in Stacc to start a guild. A guild is a group of people who meet and are interested in the same topic. The topics can range from cycling to Java development.
Guilds are heavily used in companies like Spotify, and you can read more about their usage in [this](https://sintef.brage.unit.no/sintef-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2640192/Moe+Spotify+guilds+Cultivating+knowledge+sharing+in+large-scale+agile+organizations.pdf?sequence=2) research article from Sintef.

This template gives you some rudimentary starting points in the form of an example agenda, a template for creating the meetings as issues in Github and an emphasis on defining what the outputs of the meetings/guild is going to be. The ouput is important to create value that can be utilized in some way after the meeting. For example in the React Guild, the guild maintains a tech radar for which technologies to use. The radar can be used for anyone who wants to know which technologies to use or not.

You are free to change and build upon these as you like, but we hope you can contribute your learnings back to this template. PRs are welcome!

## Example agenda for a standard meeting:

Each meeting and its agenda is published as an issue in this repository.
Each meeting has a theme that is decided on beforehand. To keep the sessions focused, each activity is timeboxed.

1. **Roundtable sharing** - Goes around to everyone who wants to share something exciting they have seen, something they worked lately or a cool code pattern they are utilizing.
2. **Spotlight** - Someone selected on beforehand showcases some work that they have done which they are proud of, want feedback on or is interesting.
3. **Output** - Produce an output or delegate responsibility of producing an output.
4. **Whats new** - Share the latest and greatest. Does not neccessarily have to follow the theme of the meeting. Meant as a fun and casual end to a meeting.

## Output of a meeting

1. Deciding the “theme” for each session on beforehand. For example creating a plan for the next 6 months to reduce the amount of organizatory work needed before each meeting.
2. Deciding which person should present in the spotlight segment.
3. Produce something that can be used later. Written, audio, video or in whichever you like.

## Output of the Guild

1. Providing a meeting place for people with similar interests to meet and discuss their chosen topic.
2. Organizing social events that are more loosely related to the topic.
3. If the topic is more work related, you can recommend or organize trips to conventions that fits your topic.

## Other details

1. I suggest having a monthly meeting. With people being split geographically it would also be nice to organize a biannual physical meeting.
2. The initial meeting will be vital as we want everyone to share the same ambition for the group.
